## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries for mobile view

### What I learned

Learnt how to use flexbox, actually this challenge gave a good amount of confidence to me as i did this completly on my own without copying css styles. I used to just copy styles before, but now i started to understand the reason behind having those properties, especially with the positioning.

### Continued development
I want to improve on flexbox and responsive designs, mainly with positioning the elements, i felt difficult while setting the background images in the correct position. Even now i feel that they are not correct. I am not sure where exactly to use `transform` property. 

Further learnings : positioning `absolute vs relative`, when to use `transform : translate()` property. 

### Useful resources.

Youtube vidoes from kevin powell and coder coder helped me in organising css.
